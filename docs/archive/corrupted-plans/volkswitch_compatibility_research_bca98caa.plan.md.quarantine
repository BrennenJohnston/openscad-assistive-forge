name: Volkswitch compatibility research
overview: "Add the missing OpenSCAD-native behaviors needed for Volkswitch keyguard projects: OpenSCAD preset .json import/export + merging, proper handling of companion files (openings_and_additions.txt + default.svg), SVG/DXF export, and a first-class console output view. Also add a linkable Volkswitch example so Ken can deep-link from his site."

    content: Extract required features from transcript + keyguard_v74.scad (include file, screenshot import, svg/dxf modes, echo-based guidance) and map them to Forge capabilities.
    status: pending
  - id: openscad-preset-import-export
    content: Implement OpenSCAD-native preset .json import/export and merge tools (multi-file import, dedupe/rename rules), while keeping existing Forge preset format supported.
    status: pending
  - id: project-files-manager
    content: "Add Project Files manager UI: upload extra files, edit openings_and_additions.txt in-app, and mount alongside the main .scad/zip project."
    status: pending
  - id: svg-dxf-export
    content: Add svg/dxf as output formats end-to-end (UI, download metadata, rendering) and add keyguard-specific guidance when selected.
    status: pending
  - id: console-ui
    content: Expose OpenSCAD console output in a dedicated panel/modal; include console output in successful render results from the worker.
    status: pending
  - id: deep-link-volksswitch-example
    content: Add built-in Volkswitch keyguard example and support URL query param (e.g., ?example=volksswitch-keyguard-v74) so Ken can link directly from Volksswitch.org.

## What the transcript + Ken’s files imply

- **Volkswitch keyguard is multi-file by design**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - The main model `include`s `openings_and_additions.txt` (`include <openings_and_additions.txt>` in `keyguard_v74.scad`).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - It can `import()` a screenshot SVG file (`screenshot_file = "default.svg";` and `import(file=screenshot_file, ...)`).
- **Ken relies on OpenSCAD’s *native* preset system**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - OpenSCAD writes a `.json` file next to the `.scad` and stores multiple “parameter sets” in one file (Wikibooks format: `parameterSets` + `fileFormatVersion`).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Ken wants import/export of those presets, and tools to merge many preset files.
- **OpenSCAD-native export needs**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Ken uses “first layer for SVG/DXF file” and expects SVG/DXF export.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Ken uses `echo()` for guidance/settings; he wants a visible console.
- **Deep-linking**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Ken wants a URL that opens Assistive Forge with the keyguard already loaded (similar to how MakerWorld links work).

- **Exports are currently 3D-only**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - `src/js/download.js`/`index.html` only offer `stl,obj,off,amf,3mf`.
- **Console output is captured but not surfaced**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Worker accumulates `openscadConsoleOutput` and includes it in error details, but there is no dedicated UI pane for it.

<!-- ✅ VALIDATION: CURRENT CAPABILITIES - ALL CONFIRMED via code review

ZIP: zip-handler.js lines 24-58 extract as TEXT only (binary limitation noted)

PRESETS: preset-manager.js lines 238-248 only accept Forge format, not OpenSCAD native

EXPORT: download.js lines 9-40 only has stl/obj/off/amf/3mf - no svg/dxf

CONSOLE: openscad-worker.js line 39 accumulates output but lines 1736-1740 only

return it on errors - must modify to return on SUCCESS too

### E) Deep-linking / website integration

- Add a query-param loader:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - `?example=volksswitch-keyguard-v74` → auto-load the built-in example.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Optionally (phase 2): `?url=<https://.../project.zip>` for remotely hosted zips (CORS permitting).

## Files likely to change

- Project files UX + deep-link:

- Be careful with **binary files in zips**:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Current `extractZipFiles()` reads everything as text; that’s fine for `.scad/.txt/.svg/.json`, but not for PNG/JPG. We can scope initial support to text assets and clearly message this in the UI.

## Test strategy (non-invasive)

- Unit tests:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Add tests for OpenSCAD preset `.json` parsing + merging behavior.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Add tests for svg/dxf format registration.

## VALIDATION SUMMARY - 2026-01-30

**Research Materials Reviewed:**

- Meeting transcript (2026-01-30 Ken/Brennen discussion - 733 lines)
- keyguard_v74.scad (7022+ lines, CC0 licensed)
- keyguard_v73.scad (comparison for version changes)
- openings_and_additions.txt (template file with variable documentation)
- Volkswitch Research links document

**Codebase Files Verified:**

- `src/js/preset-manager.js` - Import/export format confirmed
- `src/js/zip-handler.js` - Text-only extraction confirmed
- `src/js/download.js` - 3D-only formats confirmed
- `src/worker/openscad-worker.js` - Console output handling verified
- `src/main.js` - URL param and projectFiles handling verified

### ✅ CONFIRMED ACCURATE (No Changes Needed)

1. **Multi-file design** - `include <openings_and_additions.txt>` at line 1768, `screenshot_file = "default.svg"` at line 753
2. **Preset format incompatibility** - Ken's JSON uses `parameterSets` key, Forge expects `type: "openscad-preset"`
3. **SVG/DXF export need** - Line 491 shows "first layer for SVG/DXF file" option exists in keyguard
4. **Console output capture** - Line 39 `openscadConsoleOutput` exists, only returned on errors
5. **ZIP extraction capability** - Full multi-file support already in place
6. **Architecture diagram** - Accurately represents current data flow

### ⚠️ CORRECTIONS / CLARIFICATIONS

1. **Preset JSON structure** - OpenSCAD native format also includes hardcoded tablet/device data

that Ken echoes for debugging (transcript lines 599-620). The "Export Customizer settings"

feature echoes variable values to console, not just the parameterSets structure.

2. **Binary file handling** - Plan correctly notes text-only extraction, but `default.svg` files

are typically text XML. However, SVG CAN contain embedded binary (base64 images). Consider

detecting SVG MIME type and handling appropriately.

3. **Deep-linking scope** - Ken specifically mentioned wanting hyperlinks from volksswitch.org

(transcript line 661-668). The `?example=` param is good, but also consider:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Existing `getShareableURL()` in main.js for parameter sharing
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Ken mentioned "share link" feature at transcript line 682-685

### 📋 RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

Based on Ken's emphasis in the transcript:

1. **HIGH: OpenSCAD preset import** - Ken explicitly tried this and it failed (line 549)
2. **HIGH: Console output panel** - Ken uses echo() extensively for user guidance
3. **MEDIUM: SVG/DXF export** - Important for laser cutting workflow
4. **MEDIUM: Project files manager** - Needed for openings_and_additions.txt editing
5. **LOW: Deep-linking** - Nice-to-have for Ken's website integration

### 📚 OPEN SOURCE RESOURCES IDENTIFIED

1. **OpenSCAD Customizer JSON format**: Wikibooks standard, well-documented
2. **jszip**: Already in project for ZIP handling
3. **keyguard_v74.scad**: CC0 dedicated, can be used as test fixture
4. **OpenSCAD WASM**: Already using dev version with Manifold support

## Validation additions (assistant review)

CONFIRMED from research files in the provided folder:

- `openings_and_additions.txt` explicitly tells users to "look at the Console pane in OpenSCAD" and relies on `echo()` output for guidance. This reinforces the Console panel requirement and should be treated as core functionality, not just a debugging aid.
- The Volkswitch website instructions emphasize the standard OpenSCAD workflow: `.scad` + `openings_and_additions.txt` in the same folder, and a `.json` presets file that shares the base name with the `.scad` (and should be renamed when the `.scad` version changes). This implies the Forge import path should not ignore adjacent OpenSCAD preset `.json` files.
- Transcript confirms: invalid preset import error ("invalid preset file format"), the need for a link that opens the designer directly, and reliance on SVG screenshots imported by OpenSCAD.

CORRECTIONS / CLARIFICATIONS to original plan:

- SVG/DXF export in `keyguard_v74.scad` is gated by keyguard type. It contains a warning string indicating "first layer for SVG/DXF file" is not supported for **3D-Printed** keyguards. The UI should surface this as guidance when SVG/DXF is selected so users do not assume all types are valid.
- The keyguard supports **arbitrary graphics referenced in `openings_and_additions.txt`**, not just `default.svg`. The Project Files manager should allow adding multiple auxiliary assets (SVG/DXF/etc.) beyond the default screenshot file.
- Preset workflow parity: OpenSCAD auto-loads a `.json` with the same base name as the `.scad`. For parity, Forge should either auto-import that file when present in a ZIP, or prompt the user to import it.

🔍 ANNOTATION: Debugging Tip

Create a test table documenting current behavior vs. required behavior:

| Feature | Current Behavior | Ken's Requirement | Implementation File | Priority |

|---------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|

| Preset Import | Forge format only | OpenSCAD parameterSets | preset-manager.js | HIGH |

| Console Output | Errors only | Always visible | openscad-worker.js | HIGH |

| SVG/DXF Export | Not supported | Required for laser cutting | download.js | MEDIUM |

| Companion Files | No detection | Auto-detect & prompt | zip-handler.js + main.js | MEDIUM |

| Deep Linking | Hash params only | ?example= support | main.js | LOW |

**Acceptance criteria:**

- A single-page summary listing every feature gap and which Forge module will change.
- Each gap has a code reference (file + line numbers) for both current and target behavior
- Implementation order is determined based on dependencies (e.g., console UI depends on worker sending console data)

📌 ANNOTATION: HIGH PRIORITY - Preset Import/Export

This is the #1 requested feature from the transcript (line 549: "import failed invalid preset file format").

Ken explicitly tested this and it failed. Fixing this will provide immediate value.

Estimated implementation time: 6-8 hours for a junior dev

Complexity: Medium (JSON parsing + type coercion + UI integration)

**Goal:** support OpenSCAD native preset JSON (`parameterSets`) while preserving existing Forge format.

📚 ANNOTATION: OpenSCAD Native Preset Format Structure

Ken's actual JSON format (from OpenSCAD):

```json
{
  "parameterSets": {
    "PresetName1": {
      "parameter1": "value1",
      "parameter2": "value2",
      "number_param": "42",
      "boolean_param": "true"
    },
    "PresetName2": {
      "parameter1": "different_value"
    }
  },
  "fileFormatVersion": "1"
}
```

CRITICAL: All values are strings, even numbers and booleans. You MUST coerce types.

OpenSCAD also includes hardcoded tablet data that Ken echoes for debugging

(transcript lines 599-620). This extra data should be preserved but not required.

Reference: OpenSCAD source code for JSON format

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/parameter/parameterset.cc

Lines 50-120 show the serialization format.

🔧 STEP 2: Import Conversion Logic

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 2: Add new importer function `importOpenSCADNativePresets()`**

2. Add a new importer that converts OpenSCAD `parameterSets` into Forge preset objects:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Create new function** in `src/js/preset-manager.js` (after existing import functions):
   ```javascript

🐛 ANNOTATION: Common Type Coercion Pitfalls

1. **Boolean values**: OpenSCAD may use "true"/"false" or "yes"/"no" depending on parameter definition

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Solution: Check for both patterns: `stringValue === 'true' || stringValue === 'yes'`

2. **Vector/Array values**: OpenSCAD stores as strings like "[1,2,3]"

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Solution: Use JSON.parse() with try-catch
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Fallback: Keep as string if parsing fails (don't crash)

3. **Dropdown values**: OpenSCAD stores the selected string value

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Solution: Validate against `values` array in parameter schema
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Fallback: Use first option if invalid value

4. **Missing parameters**: Preset may not include all parameters (only changed values)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Solution: Don't require all parameters to be present
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - Use parameter defaults from schema

Testing checklist:

- [ ] Import preset with numbers: "42" → 42
- [ ] Import preset with booleans: "yes" → true, "no" → false
- [ ] Import preset with vectors: "[1,2,3]" → [1,2,3]
- [ ] Import preset with dropdowns: "landscape" → "landscape" (string)
- [ ] Import preset with missing parameters: should use defaults

🔧 STEP 3: Export to OpenSCAD Format

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 3: Add export to OpenSCAD native format**

3. Add export to OpenSCAD format:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Location**: Add new function in `src/js/preset-manager.js`
   ```javascript
   /**
   * Export presets to OpenSCAD native format (parameterSets)
   * @param {Array<Object>} presets - Array of Forge preset objects to export

   * @returns {void}
    */
   function exportToOpenSCADNativeFormat(presets, filename) {
     // Build parameterSets object
     const parameterSets = {};
     
     for (const preset of presets) {
       // Convert all values to strings (OpenSCAD requirement)
       const stringifiedParams = {};
       for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(preset.parameters)) {
         if (Array.isArray(value)) {
           stringifiedParams[key] = JSON.stringify(value);
         } else if (typeof value === 'boolean') {
           // Convert boolean to yes/no (OpenSCAD convention)
           stringifiedParams[key] = value ? 'yes' : 'no';
         } else {
           stringifiedParams[key] = String(value);
         }
       }
       
       parameterSets[preset.name] = stringifiedParams;
     }
     
     // Create OpenSCAD native structure
     const openscadJSON = {
       parameterSets: parameterSets,
       fileFormatVersion: "1"
     };
     
     // Download as JSON file
     const jsonString = JSON.stringify(openscadJSON, null, 2);
     const blob = new Blob([jsonString], { type: 'application/json' });

📚 ANNOTATION: OpenSCAD File Naming Convention

OpenSCAD automatically loads a JSON file with the same base name as the .scad file:

- keyguard_v74.scad → looks for keyguard_v74.json in the same directory
- This is why Ken's presets are named to match his .scad file

When exporting, ALWAYS use the .scad base name for the JSON filename.

Implementation tip: Store the original .scad filename in state.currentModelName when file is loaded.

OpenSCAD Customizer source code reference:

https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/src/parameter/parameterextractor.cc

Lines 200-250 show the auto-load logic.

📚 ANNOTATION: Ken's Python Merge Tool Reference

From transcript lines 639-649: Ken has Python code to merge multiple JSON files.

Ken's users frequently need to merge presets because:

1. Multiple therapists share presets for different tablets
2. Ken releases updated presets that need to be merged with user's custom presets
3. Users backup individual presets and need to recombine them

Ken's Python approach (conceptually):

- Load all JSON files
- Extract all parameterSets
- Check for duplicate preset names
- Prompt user for conflict resolution
- Write merged JSON

We're replicating this in JavaScript with better UX (dropdown instead of prompts).

Reference implementation (similar merge logic in JS):

https://github.com/Stuk/jszip (JSZip has similar merge patterns)

🔧 STEP 5: Auto-Import from ZIP (Optional Enhancement)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 5: Optional parity improvement - Auto-import presets from ZIP**

5. Optional parity improvement: when a ZIP upload includes a `*.json` that matches the main `.scad` base name, show a prompt to import those presets automatically.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Location**: Modify `src/js/zip-handler.js` after ZIP extraction
   ```javascript
   // In extractZipFiles() function, after identifying mainFile:
   const scadBaseName = mainFile.replace(/\.scad$/, '');
   const matchingJSON = files.find(f => f.name === `${scadBaseName}.json`);
   
   if (matchingJSON && matchingJSON.content) {
     // Found matching preset file
     try {
       const presetData = JSON.parse(matchingJSON.content);
       if (presetData.parameterSets || presetData.type) {
         // Show prompt to import
         const shouldImport = await showConfirmDialog(
           'Import Presets?',
           `Found preset file "${matchingJSON.name}". Import these presets now?`
         );
         
         if (shouldImport) {
           // Trigger preset import
           await importPresetData(presetData);
           showSuccessMessage(`Auto-imported presets from ${matchingJSON.name}`);
         }
       }
     } catch (err) {
       console.warn('Could not auto-import presets from ZIP:', err);

**Acceptance criteria:**

- ✅ Importing Ken's preset JSON no longer throws "Invalid preset file format".
- ✅ Users can export to both Forge format and OpenSCAD format.
- ✅ Multi-file import correctly merges presets with deterministic conflict behavior.
- ✅ Type coercion correctly handles numbers, booleans, vectors, and strings
- ✅ Exported JSON files follow OpenSCAD naming convention (match .scad base name)
- ✅ Console shows clear success/error messages for all operations
- ✅ All existing Forge preset functionality continues to work (backward compatibility)

🧪 ANNOTATION: Testing Strategy for Preset Import/Export

Manual Testing Checklist:

1. [ ] Import Ken's actual preset JSON from research folder
2. [ ] Verify all parameter types are correct (check in UI)
3. [ ] Export presets to OpenSCAD format
4. [ ] Re-import the exported file (round-trip test)
5. [ ] Import multiple files with duplicate names (test all conflict strategies)
6. [ ] Import Forge format preset (ensure backward compatibility)
7. [ ] Upload ZIP with matching .json file (test auto-import prompt)

Unit Test Cases (add to tests/unit/preset-manager.test.js):

```javascript
describe('OpenSCAD Native Preset Import', () => {
  it('should detect OpenSCAD native format', () => {
    const data = { parameterSets: {}, fileFormatVersion: "1" };
    expect(isOpenSCADNativeFormat(data)).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should coerce string numbers to numbers', () => {
    const preset = { "keyguard_thickness": "4.0" };
    const schema = [{ name: "keyguard_thickness", type: "number" }];
    const result = coercePresetValues(preset, schema);
    expect(result.keyguard_thickness).toBe(4.0);
    expect(typeof result.keyguard_thickness).toBe('number');
  });
  
  it('should handle yes/no as booleans', () => {
    const preset = { "have_a_case": "yes" };
    const schema = [{ name: "have_a_case", type: "boolean" }];
    const result = coercePresetValues(preset, schema);
    expect(result.have_a_case).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should rename duplicate preset names', () => {
    const presets = ['iPad 9th gen', 'iPad 9th gen'];
    const result = resolvePresetNameConflicts(presets, 'rename');
    expect(result).toEqual(['iPad 9th gen', 'iPad 9th gen (2)']);
  });
});
```

Edge Cases to Test:

- Empty parameterSets object
- Preset with only some parameters (not all)
- Invalid JSON format
- Missing fileFormatVersion
- Very large preset files (100+ presets)
- Special characters in preset names

🎯 ANNOTATION: Implementation Priority and Dependencies

This TODO should be implemented FIRST (or in parallel with console-ui).

Dependencies:

- Requires: extractParameters() from parser.js (already exists)
- Requires: State management for currentModelName (already exists)
- Requires: Modal UI for Manage Presets (already exists)
- Blocks: Auto-preset import from ZIP (Step 5)

Estimated implementation time breakdown:

- Step 1 (Format detection): 30 minutes
- Step 2 (Import conversion): 2-3 hours
- Step 3 (Export to OpenSCAD): 1-2 hours  
- Step 4 (Multi-file merge): 2-3 hours
- Step 5 (Auto-import optional): 1 hour
- Testing and debugging: 2-3 hours

Total: ~10-14 hours

Recommended approach: Implement and test each step incrementally.

Don't move to next step until current step is fully tested.

### TODO: project-files-manager (expanded)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📌 ANNOTATION: MEDIUM PRIORITY - Project Files Manager

This enables Ken's multi-file workflow with openings_and_additions.txt and default.svg.

Critical for users who want to edit companion files without re-zipping.

Estimated implementation time: 8-12 hours for a junior dev

Complexity: Medium-High (UI + file detection + state management + editor integration)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Goal:** Enable companion files management for Volkswitch and other multi-file projects.

**Implementation steps:**

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔧 STEP 1: UI for Project Files Management

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 1: Add "Project Files" UI section**

1. UI: Add a "Project Files" section near the existing file info disclosure in `index.html`.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Location**: Add after the "File Information" section, around line 200-300 in index.html

📚 ANNOTATION: Accessibility Considerations for File Manager UI

WCAG 2.1 Requirements:

1. All interactive elements must have accessible names (✅ we use aria-labelledby)
2. File list must be announced by screen readers (✅ we use role="list" and role="listitem")
3. File operations must be keyboard accessible (✅ buttons are keyboard-accessible by default)
4. Focus management when adding/removing files (implement focus trap in edit modal)
5. Error messages must be announced (use aria-live="polite" on warning div)

Enhanced accessibility:

```html
<div class="missing-files-warning" 
     id="missingFilesWarning" 
     role="alert" 
     aria-live="polite"
     style="display:none;">
```

Additional patterns to support (future):

- use <filename> - similar to include but different scope
- import("hardcoded.svg") - direct string in import()

OpenSCAD File Handling Documentation:

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Include_Statement

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Importing_Geometry

Common gotchas:

- OpenSCAD searches in: current directory, OPENSCADPATH, library paths
- Web version can only access files explicitly provided (no filesystem access)
- Case-sensitive filenames on Linux, case-insensitive on Windows

📚 ANNOTATION: Ken's openings_and_additions.txt Editor Workflow

From transcript lines 415-429:

"OpenSCAD knows that my code references this file. And so OpenSCAD knows to

look constantly at the folder to see if any changes have been made to this file.

And if it does, it rereads it in again. So I can make changes here and watch

them have effect right in the window here."

Ken values:

1. **Instant preview** - Changes appear immediately after save
2. **No round-trip** - Edit directly, no export/re-import
3. **Plain text** - No rich text formatting to corrupt syntax

Our implementation:

- "Apply & Preview" button = instant re-render (mimics Ken's Ctrl+S workflow)
- Textarea with spellcheck/autocorrect OFF (preserves syntax)
- Console output visible (helps debug vector syntax errors)

Future enhancement: Consider live preview as user types (with debounce).

Reference - Code editor patterns:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea

https://codemirror.net/ (if we want syntax highlighting later - but keep simple for now)

put it on the keyguard, wherever you specify emboss or engrave it."

openings_and_additions.txt can reference additional graphics:

- case_additions can include emboss/engrave instructions
- References arbitrary .svg or .dxf files by name
- Files must preserve original names for import() to work

Example case_additions syntax (hypothetical):

```
case_additions=[
  [1, 50, 50, "butterfly.svg", "emboss", 2], // x, y, file, operation, depth
];
```

Implementation considerations:

1. **File name preservation**: MUST keep original filename (e.g., "butterfly.svg")
2. **Binary file support**: SVG is text, but may contain base64 embedded images
3. **MIME type validation**: Check file extensions, warn about unsupported types
4. **File size limits**: Warn if file > 5MB (browser memory constraints)

Future enhancement: Parse openings_and_additions.txt to detect referenced files

and show them in the "Required Files" section.

🔧 STEP 5: Single-File to Multi-File Conversion

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 5: Convert single-file uploads to multi-file projects**

5. Ensure that single-file uploads can be converted into a multi-file project:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - When the user adds a companion file, initialize `state.projectFiles` as a Map

    * Called automatically when first companion file is added
    */
   function convertToMultiFileProject() {
     if (state.projectFiles) {
       // Already multi-file
       return;
     }
     
     console.log('Converting single-file project to multi-file');
     
     // Initialize projectFiles Map
     state.projectFiles = new Map();
     
     // Add current code as main file
     if (state.currentCode) {
       const mainFilename = state.currentModelName || 'model.scad';
       state.mainFilePath = mainFilename;
       state.projectFiles.set(mainFilename, state.currentCode);
       
       console.log(`Main file: ${mainFilename} (${state.currentCode.length} bytes)`);
     }
     
     // Update auto-preview controller
     if (autoPreviewController) {
       autoPreviewController.setProjectFiles(state.projectFiles, state.mainFilePath);
     }
   }
   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Integration point**: Call `convertToMultiFileProject()` in `handleAddCompanionFile()` before adding the first file (already shown in Step 4 code)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- ✅ A single `.scad` upload can add `openings_and_additions.txt` and `default.svg` without re-uploading a ZIP.
- ✅ Missing include files are clearly flagged with actionable UI (warning banner + list of missing files).
- ✅ Editing `openings_and_additions.txt` updates preview output immediately.
- ✅ Multiple asset files can be added and referenced by name.
- ✅ File list shows all mounted files with appropriate icons and sizes.
- ✅ Edit button only appears for text files (.txt, .scad).
- ✅ Remove button works for all non-main files.
- ✅ Accessibility: All controls are keyboard-accessible and screen-reader friendly.

🧪 ANNOTATION: Testing Strategy for Project Files Manager

Manual Testing Checklist:

1. [ ] Upload single .scad file, verify no companion files shown
2. [ ] Add openings_and_additions.txt, verify file list updates
3. [ ] Edit openings_and_additions.txt, add echo statement, verify console output
4. [ ] Add default.svg, verify preview shows screenshot (if keyguard uses it)
5. [ ] Remove a companion file, verify preview updates
6. [ ] Upload .scad with include statement, verify missing file warning appears
7. [ ] Click "Add Missing Files" button, verify file input focuses
8. [ ] Test with keyboard only (Tab, Enter, Escape)
9. [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS)
10. [ ] Upload ZIP with multiple files, verify all files shown in list

Unit Test Cases (add to tests/unit/):

```javascript
describe('Project Files Manager', () => {
  it('should detect include statements', () => {
    const code = 'include <openings_and_additions.txt>';
    const required = detectRequiredCompanionFiles(code);
    expect(required.includes).toContain('openings_and_additions.txt');
  });
  
  it('should detect screenshot_file variable', () => {
    const code = 'screenshot_file = "default.svg";';
    const required = detectRequiredCompanionFiles(code);
    expect(required.variables.screenshot_file).toBe('default.svg');
  });
  
  it('should detect import statements', () => {
    const code = 'import(file="butterfly.svg", center=true);';
    const required = detectRequiredCompanionFiles(code);
    expect(required.imports).toContain('butterfly.svg');
  });
  
  it('should identify missing files', () => {
    state.currentCode = 'include <missing.txt>';
    state.projectFiles = new Map();
    const missing = checkForMissingFiles();
    expect(missing.length).toBe(1);
    expect(missing[0].filename).toBe('missing.txt');
  });
  
  it('should convert single-file to multi-file', () => {
    state.currentCode = 'cube([10,10,10]);';
    state.currentModelName = 'test.scad';
    state.projectFiles = null;
    
    convertToMultiFileProject();
    
    expect(state.projectFiles).toBeInstanceOf(Map);
    expect(state.projectFiles.has('test.scad')).toBe(true);
    expect(state.mainFilePath).toBe('test.scad');
  });
});
```

Edge Cases to Test:

- Very large text files (> 1MB)
- Files with special characters in names
- Duplicate filenames (case variations: File.txt vs file.txt)
- Binary files (.png, .jpg) - should gracefully reject or warn
- Empty files (0 bytes)
- Files with no extension

🎯 ANNOTATION: Implementation Priority and Dependencies

This TODO should be implemented AFTER preset import OR in parallel.

Dependencies:

- Requires: autoPreviewController.setProjectFiles() (already exists)
- Requires: scanIncludes() from zip-handler.js (already exists)
- Requires: Modal UI infrastructure (already exists)
- Blocks: Full multi-file ZIP workflow
- Enables: Console output feature (companion files generate console messages)

Estimated implementation time breakdown:

- Step 1 (UI for file list): 2-3 hours
- Step 2 (File detection): 2-3 hours
- Step 3 (Text editor modal): 3-4 hours
- Step 4 (Multiple assets): 1-2 hours
- Step 5 (Single-to-multi conversion): 1 hour
- Testing and debugging: 3-4 hours

Total: ~12-17 hours

Recommended approach:

1. Start with Step 1 (UI) - visible progress
2. Implement Step 5 (conversion logic) - foundational
3. Add Step 2 (detection) - shows value immediately
4. Build Step 3 (editor) - key feature for Ken
5. Finish Step 4 (multiple assets) - polish

### TODO: svg-dxf-export (expanded)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📌 ANNOTATION: MEDIUM PRIORITY - SVG/DXF Export

This enables Ken's laser-cutting workflow. Critical for non-3D-printing users.

MakerWorld DOES NOT support this (only STL/OBJ/3MF for 3D printing).

Estimated implementation time: 4-6 hours for a junior dev

**Step 1: Register SVG/DXF formats in download.js**

1. Update `src/js/download.js`:

📚 ANNOTATION: SVG vs DXF Format Details

**SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**:

- XML-based vector format
- Human-readable text file
- Standard web format, widely supported
- Best for: Laser cutters with direct SVG import, visual verification in browser
- OpenSCAD generates: 2D projection of first layer

**DXF (Drawing Exchange Format)**:

- AutoCAD's interchange format
- Also text-based (ASCII DXF)
- Industry standard for CAD/CAM
- Best for: Professional laser cutters, CNC machines, CAD software import
- OpenSCAD generates: Same 2D geometry as SVG, different format

Ken's use case (transcript lines 332-348):

- Keyguard designed for laser cutting (not 3D printing)
- Export SVG/DXF from "first layer" mode
- Import into laser cutter software (e.g., LightBurn, LaserWeb)

OpenSCAD export command:

```bash
openscad -o output.svg input.scad
openscad -o output.dxf input.scad
```

📚 ANNOTATION: Ken's Keyguard SVG/DXF Workflow

From transcript lines 332-348 and keyguard_v74.scad line 491:

Ken's workflow:

1. Set `type_of_keyguard` to "Laser-Cut" (not "3D-Printed")
2. Set `generate` to "first layer for SVG/DXF file"
3. Render (OpenSCAD generates 2D projection)
4. Export as SVG or DXF
5. Import into laser cutter software
6. Laser cut from acrylic sheet

CRITICAL LIMITATION from keyguard_v74.scad line 491 validation:

- "first layer for SVG/DXF file" is NOT supported for 3D-Printed keyguards
- Ken's code will echo an error if wrong type selected
- Our UI should proactively guide users to avoid this mistake

OpenSCAD 2D Projection:

- `projection(cut=true)` slices 3D model at Z=0
- `projection(cut=false)` projects entire model to 2D
- Resulting 2D shape can be exported as SVG/DXF

Ken's specific usage:

- First layer represents the flat keyguard profile
- Includes all openings, cutouts, and outer shape
- No 3D features (no raised tabs, no thickness)

🔧 STEP 3: Ensure Worker Handles SVG/DXF

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 3: Verify output format flows to worker**

3. Ensure output format flows to the worker:

                                                                                                                                                                                                - `renderController.renderFull()` already accepts `outputFormat` parameter
                                                                                                                                                                                                - Verify that `outputFormat` is passed to worker message

                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Check `src/js/render-controller.js`** (should already work, but verify):
   ```javascript
   async function renderFull(options) {
     const outputFormat = options.outputFormat || state.outputFormat || 'stl';
     
     // Message to worker
     const message = {
       type: 'RENDER',
       code: state.currentCode,
       outputFormat: outputFormat,  // ✅ Should already be here
       projectFiles: state.projectFiles ? Array.from(state.projectFiles.entries()) : [],
       mainFilePath: state.mainFilePath
       // ... other options
     };
     
     worker.postMessage(message);
   }
   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Check `src/worker/openscad-worker.js`** (OpenSCAD WASM already supports all formats):
   ```javascript
   // In worker message handler:
   case 'RENDER':
     const { code, outputFormat, projectFiles, mainFilePath } = data;
     
     // OpenSCAD command line (already supports any format):
     // openscad -o /tmp/output.${outputFormat} /tmp/input.scad
     
     const args = [
       '-o', `/tmp/output.${outputFormat}`,  // ✅ Format is extension
       '/tmp/input.scad'
     ];
     
     // OpenSCAD WASM automatically detects format from extension
     // No special handling needed for SVG/DXF
     Module.callMain(args);
   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                - **✅ No changes needed** if existing code already passes `outputFormat` correctly

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📚 ANNOTATION: OpenSCAD WASM Format Support

OpenSCAD command-line handles all output formats uniformly:

```bash
openscad -o output.stl input.scad   # 3D STL
openscad -o output.svg input.scad   # 2D SVG
openscad -o output.dxf input.scad   # 2D DXF
```

The format is detected from the output file extension.

OpenSCAD WASM (already in Forge) supports:

- 3D formats: STL, OBJ, OFF, AMF, 3MF
- 2D formats: SVG, DXF, PNG (raster)
- No additional compilation or flags needed

The worker should already handle this correctly if it uses:

`-o /tmp/output.${format}` pattern.

Verify by checking openscad-worker.js around line 1500-1600 (render function).

**Step 4: Add contextual guidance for SVG/DXF users**

4. Add guidance text when SVG/DXF is selected:

                                                                                                                                                                                                - Warn that `keyguard_v74.scad` only supports this for **Laser-Cut** keyguards

📚 ANNOTATION: Volkswitch Keyguard Error Prevention

Ken's keyguard validates the generate parameter (somewhere around line 5000+):

```openscad
if (generate == "first layer for SVG/DXF file" && type_of_keyguard != "Laser-Cut") {
  echo("ERROR: first layer for SVG/DXF file is not supported for 3D-Printed keyguards");
}
```

User journey problem:

1. User selects SVG output in Forge
2. User renders (without changing parameters)
3. OpenSCAD echoes error to console
4. User confused - why didn't SVG work?

Solution:

1. Proactively detect Volkswitch keyguard (signature: "volksswitch.org" or "keyguard_designer_version")
2. Show step-by-step guidance BEFORE render
3. Highlight the TWO parameters that must be changed
4. Link guidance to console output if error occurs

This prevents the #1 user error for laser-cutting workflow.

🔧 STEP 5: Disable Preview Caching for 2D Formats

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 5: Handle preview behavior for SVG/DXF**

5. If output is SVG/DXF, ensure auto-preview does not attempt STL caching:

                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Check `src/js/auto-preview-controller.js`**:
   ```javascript
   // In preview trigger function:
   async function triggerPreview() {
     const format = state.outputFormat || 'stl';
     
     // Only use STL caching for STL format
     const useCache = (format === 'stl');
     
     if (format === 'svg' || format === 'dxf') {
       // 2D formats - no preview in 3D viewer
       // Show message instead
       showInfo('2D format selected. Render and download to view SVG/DXF output.');
       return;
     }
     
     // Continue with normal 3D preview...
   }
   ```

                                                                                                                                                                                                - **Alternative**: Show SVG preview in an iframe or img tag (if rendering to dataURL)
   ```javascript
   function displaySVGPreview(svgContent) {
     const previewDiv = document.getElementById('preview');
     previewDiv.innerHTML = `
       <div class="svg-preview-container">
         <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,${btoa(svgContent)}" 
              alt="SVG preview" 
              style="max-width: 100%; background: white;">
       </div>
     `;
   }
   ```


**Acceptance criteria:**

- ✅ Output format selector lists SVG and DXF options with descriptions.
- ✅ Selecting SVG/DXF shows contextual guidance immediately.
- ✅ Volkswitch keyguard gets specialized step-by-step instructions.
- ✅ SVG/DXF renders complete successfully without errors.
- ✅ Downloaded SVG/DXF files open correctly in:
                                                                                                                                - Web browser (SVG)
                                                                                                                                - Text editor (both - verify XML/text format)
                                                                                                                                - CAD software / laser cutter software (both)
- ✅ Preview doesn't attempt to show 2D output in 3D viewer (shows info message instead).
- ✅ All format metadata (MIME types, extensions) correct for proper file handling.

7. [ ] Render and export DXF
8. [ ] Open DXF in text editor, verify it's valid DXF format
9. [ ] Test with Volkswitch keyguard:

                                                                                                                                                                                                - Set type_of_keyguard to "Laser-Cut"
                                                                                                                                                                                                - Set generate to "first layer for SVG/DXF file"
                                                                                                                                                                                                - Render
                                                                                                                                                                                                - Export SVG/DXF
                                                                                                                                                                                                - Verify files work in laser cutter software (e.g., LightBurn)

10. [ ] Test error case: Select SVG, render 3D model without projection (should echo warning)

Test Models:

```openscad
// Simple 2D test (should export cleanly):
projection() cube([10,10,10]);

// Volkswitch first layer test:
// (Use actual keyguard_v74.scad with proper parameters)

// Error case (3D model, no projection):
cube([10,10,10]); // Should show warning in console
```

Validation Tools:

- SVG validator: https://validator.w3.org/
- DXF viewer: https://sharecad.org/ (online DXF viewer)
- Laser cutter software: LightBurn, LaserWeb (if available)

Unit Test Cases:

```javascript
describe('SVG/DXF Export', () => {
  it('should register SVG format correctly', () => {
    expect(OUTPUT_FORMATS.svg).toBeDefined();
    expect(OUTPUT_FORMATS.svg.extension).toBe('svg');
    expect(OUTPUT_FORMATS.svg.mimeType).toBe('image/svg+xml');
    expect(OUTPUT_FORMATS.svg.is2D).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should detect Volkswitch keyguard', () => {
    state.currentCode = '// Written by Volksswitch\nkeyguard_designer_version = 74;';
    expect(isVolkswitchKeyguard()).toBe(true);
  });
  
  it('should show guidance when SVG selected', () => {
    const select = document.getElementById('outputFormat');
    select.value = 'svg';
    handleOutputFormatChange();
    const guidance = document.getElementById('formatGuidance');
    expect(guidance.style.display).toBe('block');
  });
});
```

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🎯 ANNOTATION: Implementation Priority and Dependencies

This TODO can be implemented in PARALLEL with other TODOs.

Dependencies:

- Requires: Worker must pass outputFormat correctly (should already work)
- Requires: Download infrastructure (already exists)
- Blocks: Nothing (standalone feature)
- Enhances: Project files manager (SVG screenshots can be added as assets)

Estimated implementation time breakdown:

- Step 1 (Add formats to registry): 30 minutes
- Step 2 (UI dropdown + guidance): 1-2 hours
- Step 3 (Verify worker): 30 minutes (likely no changes needed)
- Step 4 (Enhanced guidance): 1-2 hours
- Step 5 (Preview handling): 1 hour
- Testing and debugging: 2-3 hours

Total: ~6-9 hours

Recommended approach:

1. Start with Step 1 (format registry) - quick win
2. Add Step 2 (UI) - visible progress
3. Verify Step 3 (worker) - likely already works
4. Polish with Step 4 (guidance) - key UX improvement
5. Finish with Step 5 (preview) - edge case handling

QUICK WIN: Steps 1-3 can be completed in ~2 hours for basic functionality.

Steps 4-5 are enhancements that significantly improve UX.

### TODO: console-ui (expanded)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📌 ANNOTATION: HIGH PRIORITY - Console Output Panel

Ken heavily relies on echo() for user guidance and debugging.

MakerWorld does NOT expose console at all - major competitive advantage for Forge.

From transcript lines 304-314:

"my use of this is really primitive. It's just the only place I can put in

information is echo it to the console... this is one of the major ways I

communicate with people who are doing design"

Estimated implementation time: 6-8 hours for a junior dev

Complexity: Medium (Worker modification + UI panel + state management)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Goal:** Show OpenSCAD console output on both success and error renders.

**Implementation steps:**

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔧 STEP 1: Worker - Include Console Output on Success

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 1: Modify worker to return console output on success**

1. In `src/worker/openscad-worker.js`, include `consoleOutput` on success:

                                                - **Current behavior** (around line 1736-1740): Console output only returned on errors
                                                - **Location**: Find the success response message (type: 'COMPLETE')
   ```javascript
   // CURRENT CODE (around line 1736-1740):
   case 'RENDER':
     try {
       // ... render logic ...
       
       // On success:
       postMessage({
         type: 'COMPLETE',
         data: outputData,
         stats: renderStats
         // ❌ Console output NOT included
       });
     } catch (error) {
       // On error:
       postMessage({
         type: 'ERROR',
         error: error.message,
         consoleOutput: openscadConsoleOutput  // ✅ Only here
       });
     }
   
   // UPDATED CODE (add consoleOutput to success):
   case 'RENDER':
     try {
       // ... render logic ...
       
       // On success:
       postMessage({
         type: 'COMPLETE',
         data: outputData,
         stats: renderStats,
         consoleOutput: openscadConsoleOutput  // ✅ ADD THIS
       });
     } catch (error) {
       // On error:
       postMessage({
         type: 'ERROR',
         error: error.message,
         consoleOutput: openscadConsoleOutput  // ✅ Keep existing
       });
     }
   ```

                                                - Add `consoleOutput: openscadConsoleOutput` to the `COMPLETE` payload
                                                - **Verify**: `openscadConsoleOutput` is cleared at the start of each render (line 1219)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📚 ANNOTATION: OpenSCAD Console Output Format

OpenSCAD console output format:

```
ECHO: "message text"
ECHO: variable = value
WARNING: warning message
ERROR: error message
Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
Compiling design (CSG Products generation)...
```

Ken's echo() usage patterns (from openings_and_additions.txt lines 127-140):

```openscad
echo(th=th);  // Variable inspection
// Output: ECHO: th = 184

echo("WARNING: Configuration not supported");  // User warnings
// Output: ECHO: "WARNING: Configuration not supported"
```

Console output accumulation:

- Worker accumulates ALL stdout/stderr from OpenSCAD WASM
- Includes: ECHO statements, WARNING messages, ERROR messages, compilation progress
- Size: Typically 1-5 KB for simple models, can be 50-100 KB for complex models with many echoes

Performance consideration:

- Console output is text, minimal impact on message size
- Should NOT be excluded to save bandwidth (users need it)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔧 STEP 2: State Management for Console Output

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 2: Store console output in state**

2. In `src/main.js`, store console output in state on every successful render:

                                                - **Add to state object**:
   ```javascript
   // In state initialization (around top of file):
   const state = {
     // ... existing state properties ...
     lastConsoleOutput: '',       // Most recent console output
     consoleHistory: [],          // Array of {timestamp, output} objects
     maxConsoleHistory: 10        // Keep last 10 renders
   };
   ```

                                                - **Update when render results arrive**:
   ```javascript
   // In worker message handler:
   worker.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
     const { type, data, consoleOutput, stats, error } = event.data;
     
     switch (type) {
       case 'COMPLETE':
         // Store console output
         if (consoleOutput !== undefined) {
           state.lastConsoleOutput = consoleOutput;
           
           // Add to history with timestamp
           state.consoleHistory.push({
             timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
             output: consoleOutput,
             renderType: stats?.renderType || 'full'
           });
           
           // Trim history to max length
           if (state.consoleHistory.length > state.maxConsoleHistory) {
             state.consoleHistory.shift();
           }
           
           // Update console UI
           updateConsoleDisplay(consoleOutput);
         }
         
         // ... rest of success handling ...
         break;
       
       case 'ERROR':
         // Store error console output
         if (consoleOutput !== undefined) {
           state.lastConsoleOutput = consoleOutput;
           updateConsoleDisplay(consoleOutput);
         }
         
         // Show error dialog with console output
         showErrorDialog(error, consoleOutput);
         break;
     }
   });
   ```

                                                - Update when render results arrive (both full render and preview where available)
                                                - **Note**: Preview renders also have console output (Ken may use echo() to debug)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📚 ANNOTATION: Console History and State Management

Why keep console history:

1. User can compare output between renders
2. Debug parameter changes ("What echo value did I see 3 renders ago?")
3. Support workflow: "Send me your last 3 console outputs"

History structure:

```javascript
consoleHistory = [
  {
    timestamp: "2026-01-30T15:23:45.123Z",
    output: "ECHO: th = 184\nECHO: tw = 250\n",
    renderType: "full" // or "preview"
  },
  // ... up to 10 entries
]
```

Storage consideration:

- 10 renders × ~5KB average = ~50KB in memory
- Acceptable for web app
- Don't persist to localStorage (can be large, not critical to save)

Alternative: Show only lastConsoleOutput, add "Show History" button if needed.

**Step 3: Add Console UI panel**

3. Add UI panel or modal:

                                                - **Option A**: New panel in Preview Settings drawer (recommended for quick access)
                                                - **Option B**: Modal dialog triggered by button in Advanced menu
                                                - **Recommended**: Option A (always visible, non-intrusive)

📚 ANNOTATION: Console Panel UI Design Considerations

Design decisions:

1. **Always visible (not modal)**: Users need to see console while adjusting parameters
2. **Collapsible**: Save screen space when not needed
3. **Syntax highlighting**: Visual distinction between ECHO/WARNING/ERROR
4. **Copy button**: Essential for support requests
5. **Line count**: Helps users gauge output size
6. **Scroll to bottom**: New output is usually most relevant
7. **Max height 300px**: Prevents consuming entire screen

Accessibility features:

- role="log" + aria-live="polite": Screen reader announces new messages
- aria-atomic="false": Only announce changes, not entire log
- aria-label on controls: Clear button purpose
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through buttons, focus management

Ken's console use cases (from transcript):

1. **Warning messages**: "is not supported" alerts
2. **Debug variable values**: echo(variable=value)
3. **Export Customizer settings**: Dump all parameters
4. **Step-by-step guidance**: Multi-line instructions

MakerWorld limitation (transcript line 294):

"Makerworld does not expose this console"

This is a MAJOR pain point. Our console panel is a competitive advantage.

🔧 STEP 4: Integrate Console with Error Dialogs

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 4: Append console output to error dialogs**

4. For errors, append console output into the user-facing error dialog:

                                                - **Modify error dialog function** (in `src/main.js`):
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Show error dialog with console output
    * @param {string} errorMessage - Main error message
    * @param {string} consoleOutput - Full console output
    */
   function showErrorDialog(errorMessage, consoleOutput) {
     const modal = createErrorModal();
     
     // Error message
     const errorText = document.createElement('div');
     errorText.className = 'error-message';
     errorText.innerHTML = `
       <h3>❌ Render Error</h3>
       <p>${escapeHtml(errorMessage)}</p>
     `;
     
     // Console output section (collapsible)
     const consoleSection = document.createElement('details');
     consoleSection.className = 'error-console-section';
     consoleSection.open = true; // Start expanded
     
     consoleSection.innerHTML = `
       <summary>📋 Console Output (click to collapse)</summary>
       <pre class="error-console-output">${escapeHtml(consoleOutput || 'No console output available')}</pre>
       <button onclick="copyTextToClipboard(\`${escapeHtml(consoleOutput)}\`)">
         Copy Console Output
       </button>
     `;
     
     modal.appendChild(errorText);
     modal.appendChild(consoleSection);
     
     // Help text
     const helpText = document.createElement('p');
     helpText.className = 'error-help';
     helpText.innerHTML = `
       <strong>Troubleshooting tips:</strong><br>
       1. Check the console output above for specific error messages<br>
       2. Look for ECHO: lines that may indicate the issue<br>
       3. Copy the console output and search for error messages online<br>
       4. If reporting a bug, include the full console output
     `;
     modal.appendChild(helpText);
     
     document.body.appendChild(modal);
   }
   ```

                                                - **Include console output in bug report exports** (if feature exists)

**Acceptance criteria:**

- ✅ Echo messages from `openings_and_additions.txt` are visible after successful renders.
- ✅ Echo messages appear in both full renders and preview renders.
- ✅ Console output updates in real-time after each render.
- ✅ Users can copy console text for support/debugging (one-click copy button).
- ✅ Console panel is collapsible to save screen space.
- ✅ Syntax highlighting distinguishes ECHO/WARNING/ERROR messages.
- ✅ Line count and timestamp displayed for user reference.
- ✅ Error dialogs include full console output with copy button.
- ✅ Accessibility: Screen reader announces errors/warnings, keyboard navigation works.
- ✅ High contrast mode: Console is readable with appropriate colors.

🧪 ANNOTATION: Testing Strategy for Console UI

Manual Testing Checklist:

1. [ ] Render simple model with echo statement, verify output appears
2. [ ] Render Ken's keyguard with "Export Customizer settings", verify all echoes visible
3. [ ] Test copy button, verify clipboard contains exact output
4. [ ] Test clear button, verify console empties
5. [ ] Test collapse/expand button, verify panel hides/shows
6. [ ] Trigger render error, verify console output in error dialog
7. [ ] Test with very long output (1000+ lines), verify scroll works
8. [ ] Test with keyboard only (Tab navigation, Enter to activate buttons)
9. [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA/JAWS):

                                                - Verify echo messages are announced
                                                - Verify warning/error announcements
                                                - Verify button labels are clear

10. [ ] Test in high contrast mode, verify text is readable

Test Models:

```openscad
// Simple echo test:
echo("Hello from OpenSCAD!");
echo(test_value=42);
cube([10,10,10]);

// Warning test:
if (true) echo("WARNING: This is a test warning");

// Error test (syntax error):
cube([10,10,10]  // Missing closing bracket

// Ken's Export Customizer Settings test:
// Use keyguard_v74.scad with generate="Customizer settings"
```

Expected Outputs:

```
ECHO: "Hello from OpenSCAD!"
ECHO: test_value = 42
Compiling design (CSG Tree generation)...
Compiling design (CSG Products generation)...
Geometries in cache: 1
Geometry cache size in bytes: 960
CGAL Polyhedrons in cache: 0
CGAL cache size in bytes: 0
Total rendering time: 0:00:00.123
```

Unit Test Cases:

```javascript
describe('Console UI', () => {
  it('should store console output in state', () => {
    const output = 'ECHO: test = 123';
    state.lastConsoleOutput = output;
    expect(state.lastConsoleOutput).toBe(output);
  });
  
  it('should highlight ECHO lines', () => {
    const output = 'ECHO: test';
    const highlighted = highlightConsoleOutput(output);
    expect(highlighted).toContain('class="echo-line"');
  });
  
  it('should highlight WARNING lines', () => {
    const output = 'WARNING: problem';
    const highlighted = highlightConsoleOutput(output);
    expect(highlighted).toContain('class="warning-line"');
  });
  
  it('should count lines correctly', () => {
    const output = 'line1\nline2\nline3';
    const lines = output.split('\n').length;
    expect(lines).toBe(3);
  });
  
  it('should copy to clipboard', async () => {
    state.lastConsoleOutput = 'test output';
    await copyConsoleOutput();
    const clipboardText = await navigator.clipboard.readText();
    expect(clipboardText).toBe('test output');
  });
});
```

Edge Cases:

- Empty console output (no echoes)
- Very large output (50,000+ lines)
- Unicode characters in output
- ANSI escape codes (strip them)
- Null/undefined output

🎯 ANNOTATION: Implementation Priority and Dependencies

This TODO should be implemented EARLY (HIGH priority).

Can be done in PARALLEL with preset import.

Dependencies:

- Requires: Worker to include console output in success response (Step 1)
- Requires: State management for lastConsoleOutput (Step 2)
- Requires: Modal/Panel UI infrastructure (already exists)
- Enables: Better debugging for ALL other features
- Enhances: Error reporting and user support

Estimated implementation time breakdown:

- Step 1 (Worker modification): 30 minutes
- Step 2 (State management): 1 hour
- Step 3 (Console UI panel): 4-5 hours
- Step 4 (Error dialog integration): 1-2 hours
- Testing and debugging: 2-3 hours

Total: ~9-12 hours

Recommended approach:

1. Start with Step 1 (worker) - quick, enables everything else
2. Add Step 2 (state) - foundation for UI
3. Build Step 3 (UI panel) - most visible work
4. Polish with Step 4 (error integration) - nice-to-have

QUICK WIN: Steps 1-2 can be completed in ~90 minutes.

Step 3 provides the visible UI that users will love.

### TODO: deep-link-volksswitch-example (expanded)

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📌 ANNOTATION: LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY - Deep Linking & Built-in Example

Enables Ken to link directly from volksswitch.org to a pre-loaded keyguard.

Similar to how MakerWorld provides shareable links.

From transcript lines 661-668:

"I would prefer that people could just come here to OpenSCAD Assisted Forge

somehow, and just see a link or something to do key guard or there's a special

a special information tag down to the end of the URL that it brings up my

designer in this environment."

Estimated implementation time: 6-8 hours for a junior dev

Complexity: Medium (File organization + URL parsing + example registration)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Goal:** Allow direct links from Volkswitch website to a pre-loaded keyguard example.

**Implementation steps:**

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔧 STEP 1: Prepare Volkswitch Example Files

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 1: Add built-in Volkswitch example to public/examples/**

1. Add a built-in example under `public/examples/` (ZIP or SCAD + companion files):

            - **Directory structure**:
   ```
   public/examples/volkswitch-keyguard-v74/
   ├── keyguard_v74.scad
   ├── openings_and_additions.txt
   ├── default.svg (optional screenshot)
   ├── README.md (usage instructions)
   └── metadata.json (example metadata)
   ```

            - Suggested key: `volkswitch-keyguard-v74`

            - **metadata.json** format:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "volkswitch-keyguard-v74",
     "name": "Volkswitch Keyguard Designer v74",
     "description": "Customizable 3D-printable and laser-cut keyguard for grid-based, free-form, and hybrid AAC apps on tablets",
     "author": "Volksswitch",
     "authorUrl": "https://volksswitch.org",
     "license": "CC0",
     "version": "74",
     "mainFile": "keyguard_v74.scad",
     "companionFiles": [
       "openings_and_additions.txt",
       "default.svg"
     ],
     "tags": ["accessibility", "AAC", "keyguard", "tablet", "assistive-technology"],
     "thumbnail": "thumbnail.png",
     "complexity": "advanced",
     "estimatedRenderTime": "fast"
   }
   ```

            - **Licensing note**: Ken's keyguard is CC0 (public domain dedication), confirmed in keyguard_v74.scad lines 1-9
            - **File sourcing**: Use actual keyguard_v74.scad from research folder
            - **Screenshot**: Include a sample `default.svg` so example renders with visual reference

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📚 ANNOTATION: Built-in Examples Best Practices

Example organization patterns (from similar projects):

1. **OpenJSCAD**: Examples in `packages/examples/`
2. **Thingiverse Customizer**: Built-in examples in dropdown
3. **MakerWorld**: Examples as separate model pages

Our approach:

- Store in `public/examples/` (served statically, no build step)
- Each example in its own directory
- Include metadata.json for discovery
- Support both single-file and multi-file examples

File size considerations:

- keyguard_v74.scad is ~350KB (large but acceptable)
- openings_and_additions.txt is ~3KB
- default.svg (if included) is typically 50-200KB
- Total: ~400-500KB for this example
- Acceptable for one-time download

Alternative: Load examples from CDN or GitHub releases (future enhancement).

📚 ANNOTATION: Example Loading Architecture

Loading strategies:

1. **Static files** (our approach): Files served from public/examples/

            - Pro: Simple, no backend needed
            - Pro: Files cached by browser
            - Con: Examples included in initial download (can use lazy loading)

2. **Dynamic fetch**: Load from external URL

            - Pro: Examples not in main bundle
            - Con: Requires CORS, external dependency
            - Use case: Community-contributed examples

3. **Embedded**: Examples in JavaScript as strings

            - Pro: Guaranteed availability
            - Con: Increases bundle size
            - Use case: Small tutorial examples

Our implementation uses Strategy #1 with lazy loading (fetch on demand).

Error handling:

- Main file MUST load (throw error if not found)
- Companion files are optional (warn but continue)
- Network errors: Show user-friendly message with retry option

State management:

- Store `currentExample` metadata in state
- Allows "Reset to example defaults" feature
- Enables attribution display in UI

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔧 STEP 3: URL Query Parameter Handling

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 3: Add URL query parameter handling**

3. Add URL query handling:

            - Parse `?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74` on load
            - Call `loadExampleByKey()` with that key before showing the main UI
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Parse URL query parameters and handle example loading
    * Call this on page load (DOMContentLoaded)
    */
   function handleURLParameters() {
     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     const exampleKey = urlParams.get('example');
     
     if (exampleKey) {
       console.log(`URL parameter detected: ?example=${exampleKey}`);
       
       // Load example
       loadExampleByKey(exampleKey);
       
       // Update URL to remove query parameter (clean history)
       // Optional: Comment out if you want to keep parameter visible
       const cleanURL = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname + window.location.hash;
       window.history.replaceState({}, '', cleanURL);
     }
   }
   
   // Call on page load
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
     handleURLParameters();
     
     // ... rest of initialization ...
   });
   ```

            - **URL format examples**:
                    - Basic: `https://forge.example.com/?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74`
                    - With parameters: `https://forge.example.com/?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74#v=1&params=...`

            - **Integration with existing welcome screen**:
   ```javascript
   // Modify welcome screen to check for URL parameter
   function showWelcomeScreen() {
     // If URL has example parameter, skip welcome screen
     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     if (urlParams.has('example')) {
       // Example will be loaded by handleURLParameters()
       return;
     }
     
     // Otherwise show normal welcome screen
     // ... existing code ...
   }
   ```


<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📚 ANNOTATION: URL Parameter Patterns and Security

URL parameter formats:

1. **?example=key** - Load example by key
2. **?example=key&param=value** - Load example with parameter overrides
3. **?url=https://...** - Load from external URL (future enhancement)

Security considerations:

- MUST validate example key against EXAMPLE_DEFINITIONS (prevent path traversal)
- MUST NOT allow arbitrary URL loading without CORS check
- MUST sanitize all input before displaying

Example validation:

```javascript
function isValidExampleKey(key) {
  // Only allow alphanumeric, dash, underscore
  return /^[a-z0-9_-]+$/i.test(key) && EXAMPLE_DEFINITIONS.hasOwnProperty(key);
}
```

Existing Forge URL patterns (from transcript line 674-692):

- Ken mentioned "share link" feature exists
- Forge has `getShareableURL()` in main.js
- Current format: hash-based parameters `#v=1&params=...`

Our ?example= parameter complements existing hash params:

- Query params: Which example to load
- Hash params: Parameter values for that example

Both can coexist:

`?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74#v=1&keyguard_thickness=3.5`

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

🔧 STEP 4: Compatibility with Existing Share Links

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

**Step 4: Ensure parameter hash support still works**

4. Ensure parameter hash support still works:

            - Example loading should not break `#v=1&params=...` URL overrides
            - Hash parameters should be applied AFTER example loads
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Enhanced example loading with hash parameter support
    */
   async function loadExampleByKey(exampleKey) {
     // ... load example files as shown in Step 2 ...
     
     // After example is loaded, check for hash parameters
     if (window.location.hash) {
       console.log('Hash parameters detected, applying after example load...');
       
       // Delay to allow example to fully initialize
       setTimeout(() => {
         applyHashParameters();
       }, 500);
     }
   }
   
   /**
    * Apply parameters from URL hash
    * (This function likely already exists in codebase)
    */
   function applyHashParameters() {
     const hash = window.location.hash.substring(1); // Remove '#'
     const params = new URLSearchParams(hash);
     
     // Apply version check
     const version = params.get('v');
     if (version !== '1') {
       console.warn(`Unknown share link version: ${version}`);
       return;
     }
     
     // Apply parameters
     const paramsJSON = params.get('params');
     if (paramsJSON) {
       try {
         const paramValues = JSON.parse(decodeURIComponent(paramsJSON));
         applyParameterValues(paramValues);
         console.log('Applied hash parameters:', paramValues);
       } catch (err) {
         console.error('Failed to parse hash parameters:', err);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

            - **Test URL**: `?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74#v=1&params={"keyguard_thickness":3.5}`
            - **Expected behavior**: Load example, then apply parameter overrides

<!-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

📚 ANNOTATION: Share Link Compatibility

Existing share link format (from main.js getShareableURL()):

```javascript
function getShareableURL() {
  const params = {
    // Current parameter values
  };
  const hash = `#v=1&params=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(params))}`;
  return window.location.origin + window.location.pathname + hash;
}
```

Enhanced for examples:

```javascript
function getShareableURL() {
  let url = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname;
  
  // Add example parameter if loaded from example
  if (state.currentExample) {
    url += `?example=${state.currentExample.id}`;
  }
  
  // Add parameter hash
  const params = getCurrentParameters();
  const hash = `#v=1&params=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(params))}`;
  url += hash;
  
  return url;
}
```

Use cases:

1. **Load example with defaults**: `?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74`
2. **Load example with specific params**: `?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74#v=1&params={...}`
3. **Share customized example**: User modifies params, clicks Share, gets full URL

Loading sequence:

1. Page load
2. Parse ?example= parameter
3. Fetch and load example files
4. Initialize UI with example code
5. Parse #v=1&params=... hash
6. Override parameters with hash values
7. Trigger render with final parameters

- ✅ Example appears in Examples gallery with thumbnail and description.
- ✅ Direct link is documented in Help section.
- ✅ Loading errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages.
- ✅ Example attribution (author, license) is displayed.

🧪 ANNOTATION: Testing Strategy for Deep Linking

Manual Testing Checklist:

1. [ ] Visit `?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74` in fresh browser session
2. [ ] Verify keyguard loads with all companion files
3. [ ] Check Project Files UI shows 3 files (scad, txt, svg)
4. [ ] Verify preview renders successfully
5. [ ] Check console output appears
6. [ ] Modify a parameter, click Share, verify URL includes ?example=
7. [ ] Test combined URL: `?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74#v=1&params={"keyguard_thickness":5}`
8. [ ] Verify parameters from hash override example defaults
9. [ ] Test invalid example key: `?example=nonexistent`
10. [ ] Test network error (block fetch request), verify error message
11. [ ] Test from Examples gallery button
12. [ ] Test from Welcome screen link
13. [ ] Verify browser back/forward navigation works
14. [ ] Test with screen reader (announcements on load)

Test URLs:

```
# Basic example load:
http://localhost:3000/?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74

# With parameter overrides:
http://localhost:3000/?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74#v=1&params={"type_of_keyguard":"Laser-Cut","generate":"first%20layer%20for%20SVG/DXF%20file"}

# Invalid example:
http://localhost:3000/?example=invalid-example

# Example with trailing slash:
http://localhost:3000/?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74/
```

Expected behaviors:

- Example loads within 2-3 seconds (depending on network)
- Loading indicator shown during fetch
- Success message after load
- URL cleaned up (or kept with ?example= for shareability)
- Back button returns to previous page (not example loading state)

Unit Test Cases:

```javascript
describe('Deep Linking', () => {
  it('should parse example parameter from URL', () => {
    window.history.pushState({}, '', '?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74');
    handleURLParameters();
    expect(loadExampleByKey).toHaveBeenCalledWith('volkswitch-keyguard-v74');
  });
  
  it('should validate example keys', () => {
    expect(isValidExampleKey('volkswitch-keyguard-v74')).toBe(true);
    expect(isValidExampleKey('../../../etc/passwd')).toBe(false);
    expect(isValidExampleKey('invalid-example')).toBe(false);
  });
  
  it('should load example with companion files', async () => {
    await loadExampleByKey('volkswitch-keyguard-v74');
    expect(state.projectFiles.size).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2); // scad + txt minimum
  });
  
  it('should apply hash parameters after example load', async () => {
    window.location.hash = '#v=1&params={"keyguard_thickness":5}';
    await loadExampleByKey('volkswitch-keyguard-v74');
    // Wait for hash parameter application
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 600));
    expect(state.parameters.keyguard_thickness).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

Edge Cases:

- Example with missing companion files (should warn but continue)
- Example with very large files (progress indicator)
- Concurrent example loads (debounce/cancel previous)
- Example load while render in progress (queue or cancel)
- Network timeout (retry with backoff)

🎯 ANNOTATION: Implementation Priority and Dependencies

This TODO can be implemented LAST (LOW priority) or in PARALLEL.

Dependencies:

- Requires: Project files manager (to show companion files)
- Requires: Console UI (to show echo messages from example)
- Requires: Basic file loading infrastructure (already exists)
- Enhances: User onboarding and discoverability
- Enables: Ken to link from volksswitch.org

Estimated implementation time breakdown:

- Step 1 (Prepare example files): 2-3 hours (includes testing files work)
- Step 2 (Register example): 1 hour
- Step 3 (URL parsing): 2 hours
- Step 4 (Hash parameter compat): 2 hours
- Step 5 (UI gallery): 3-4 hours
- Testing and debugging: 2-3 hours

Total: ~12-15 hours

Recommended approach:

1. Start with Step 3 (URL parsing) - core functionality
2. Add Step 2 (registration) - wires up example
3. Prepare Step 1 (files) - can be done in parallel
4. Implement Step 4 (hash compat) - important for share links
5. Polish with Step 5 (UI) - nice-to-have discovery feature

QUICK WIN: Steps 1-3 can provide basic functionality in ~5 hours.

Step 5 (UI gallery) is polish that significantly improves discoverability.

Ken's immediate need (transcript line 661-668):

"I would prefer that people could just come here to OpenSCAD Assisted Forge

somehow, and just see a link... a special information tag down to the end of

the URL that it brings up my designer in this environment."

Steps 1-3 satisfy this requirement. Step 5 is bonus UX.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

## Additional testing guidance (junior-friendly)

- Preset import: use a native OpenSCAD `parameterSets` JSON and verify values load into UI.
- Project files: upload only `.scad`, then add `openings_and_additions.txt` and `default.svg`; confirm preview updates.
- SVG/DXF export: select SVG/DXF, set `generate` to "first layer for SVG/DXF file", confirm output downloads.
- Console: add `echo(test=123);` to `openings_and_additions.txt`, confirm it appears in Console panel.
- Deep link: open `/?example=volkswitch-keyguard-v74` in a new tab and ensure the example loads.

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Current Limitations
1. **Binary files in ZIP**: Only text files supported (not blocking for Ken)
2. **SVG preview**: 2D exports don't show in 3D viewer (intentional, shows message instead)
3. **Preset version migration**: No automated migration tool (Ken has Python script)
4. **Real-time collaboration**: Not supported (single-user design)

### Future Enhancement Ideas
1. **Preset version migration tool**: Detect parameter renames, prompt for migration
2. **Community examples gallery**: User-contributed examples (requires backend)
3. **Preset marketplace**: Share/discover presets (requires authentication)
4. **Binary file support**: Handle images in ZIP (base64 encode or FileReader)
5. **Advanced console features**: Search, filter, export, timestamps
6. **Project templates**: Save entire multi-file project as template
7. **Parameter constraints**: Min/max validation from SCAD comments
8. **Diff view**: Compare two presets side-by-side

### Potential Integration Points
- **volksswitch.org**: Deep link integration (already planned)
- **GitHub**: Load examples from GitHub repos (URL parameter)
- **Thingiverse/Printables**: Export preset as Thing customization
- **LightBurn**: Direct SVG/DXF export to laser cutter software

## 🎓 LEARNING RESOURCES FOR JUNIOR DEVELOPERS

### Recommended Learning Path

**Before Starting Implementation**
1. Read OpenSCAD User Manual (focus on Customizer section)
2. Review Forge's existing codebase architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. Study Ken's keyguard_v74.scad (understand parameter structure)
4. Read transcript for context on user needs

**During Implementation**
1. Reference this plan's code examples (copy-paste starting points)
2. Use browser DevTools for debugging (Console, Network, Elements tabs)
3. Test incrementally (after each function, verify it works)
4. Ask questions in team chat (don't stay blocked > 30 minutes)

**Key Concepts to Understand**
- **JSON parsing**: Preset import/export (MDN: JSON.parse/JSON.stringify)
- **File API**: Reading uploaded files (MDN: File, FileReader, Blob)
- **Map data structure**: Project files storage (MDN: Map)
- **Async/await**: File loading (MDN: Promises, async functions)
- **URL parameters**: Deep linking (MDN: URLSearchParams)
- **ARIA**: Accessibility (MDN: ARIA roles and states)

### Debugging Tips

**Common Issues & Solutions**
1. **"Invalid preset file format"**
   - Check: Is `parameterSets` key present?
   - Check: Is format detection running before Forge format check?
   - Debug: `console.log(JSON.parse(presetJSON))`

2. **"Include file not found"**
   - Check: Is file in `state.projectFiles` Map?
   - Check: Is filename exact match (case-sensitive)?
   - Debug: `console.log(Array.from(state.projectFiles.keys()))`

3. **Console output empty**
   - Check: Did worker include `consoleOutput` in success message?
   - Check: Is `updateConsoleDisplay()` called after render?
   - Debug: `console.log('consoleOutput:', event.data.consoleOutput)`

4. **SVG export failed**
   - Check: Is model 2D or using projection()?
   - Check: Is `generate` set to "first layer for SVG/DXF file"?
   - Check: Console output for OpenSCAD errors

### Code Review Checklist

Before marking TODO as complete:
- [ ] Code follows existing style (check eslint)
- [ ] All functions have JSDoc comments
- [ ] Error handling for all async operations
- [ ] User-facing errors have helpful messages
- [ ] Console logs removed or changed to debug level
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants)
- [ ] Accessibility attributes present (aria-*)
- [ ] Unit tests added (at least happy path)
- [ ] Manual testing completed (checklist items)
- [ ] Code reviewed by senior developer
