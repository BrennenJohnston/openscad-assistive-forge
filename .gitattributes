# Git LFS tracking for large binary files
# See: https://git-lfs.com
#
# Files matching these patterns are stored in Git LFS rather than as regular
# Git objects. This allows bundles of 200+ MB to be committed without hitting
# GitHub's 100 MB hard limit or 50 MB warning threshold.
#
# Users who clone or fork this branch need Git LFS installed:
#   git lfs install
#   git lfs pull
#
# GitHub's "Download ZIP" and web-based uploads work without LFS installed.
