## Checklist

| --- | --- |
| **Text-first format** | New docs are Markdown (or equivalent text-first format) |
| **Image alt text** | All images have alt text or nearby text equivalent |
| **No image-only instructions** | Screenshots are supplemental, not the only instructions |
| **Chunked audits** | Large audits split into individual issue cards |
| **Video summaries** | Video evidence has written summary + timestamps |
| **External doc conversion** | External documents converted to text-first before acting |
| **Playback speed** | Video/audio hosted where user-controlled speed is available |
