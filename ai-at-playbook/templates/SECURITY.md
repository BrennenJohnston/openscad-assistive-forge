# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately.
**Do not open a public issue.**

**Contact:** `[CONFIGURE: private email or GitHub Security Advisories URL]`

You should receive an acknowledgment within `[CONFIGURE: e.g., 48 hours]`.

## What to include

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it (or a proof of concept)
- The impact as you understand it
- Any suggested fix (optional, but helpful)

## What to expect

1. We acknowledge your report within `[CONFIGURE: e.g., 48 hours]`
2. We investigate and confirm the issue
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release the fix and credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Scope

This policy covers the `[CONFIGURE: project name]` repository and its deployed
instances. Third-party dependencies are covered by their own security policies.

## Security practices

- We use protected branches and required CI checks
- We run dependency update automation (`[CONFIGURE: e.g., Dependabot, Renovate]`)
- We run code scanning in CI (`[CONFIGURE: e.g., CodeQL, Semgrep, or "planned"]`)
- We enforce MFA for privileged contributors

## AI-specific note

This project uses AI-assisted development. AI-generated code is reviewed with the
same security rigor as human-written code. If you find a vulnerability that appears
to be AI-generated (e.g., a hardcoded credential in an AI-generated file), please
include that context in your report.
